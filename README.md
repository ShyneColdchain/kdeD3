Interactive Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) + histogram in D3. 

Largely taken from KDE from examples.

Including D3-tip for interactivity.

--Learning D3!-- 

1. allAge is 5000 simulated individuals of different ages representing the population
2. sampleAge is 500 randomly choosen individuals from the population
3. kdeD3 creates interactive histogram with kernel density estimation 
4. kde for sample can be compared to real values from population for statistical inference 


Goals: 

1. further interactivity!
2. metadata appear with mouse over (ex. % female / male) 
3. both sampleAge and allAge histograms on single plot
