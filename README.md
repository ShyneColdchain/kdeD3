Interactive Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) + histogram in D3. 

Partially from KDE examples.

Including D3-tip for interactivity.

--Learning D3!-- 

1. allAge is 5000 simulated individuals of different ages representing the population - *Gray histogram*
2. sampleAge is 500 randomly choosen individuals from the population  - *Purple histogram*
3. kdeD3 creates interactive histogram with kernel density estimation - *black line with red fill* 
4. kde for sample can be compared to real values from population for statistical inference
5. Switching between different sample datasets / histograms demonstrates bias in sampling methods. 


Goals: 

1. further interactivity!
2. metadata appear with mouse over (ex. % female / male) - *DONE*
3. both sampleAge and allAge histograms on single plot - *DONE* 
4. Switch between three (or so) different sample datasets on mouse click 
5. Expand each bar on mouse click - to show more metadata
